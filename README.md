# Surfs_Up

## Overview

After completing the module, W.Avy wanted us to inquire more information on the changes in temperature. He is curious about the months of June and December in Oahu because this determines if his surf shop can be sustainable year round. For this challenge, we utilize the sqlalchemy tool to extract the information from the SQLite database.

## Results

For the deliverables,  we inquired the summary statistics for the month of June and December.

-The first difference we notice is the mean temperature of June and December. June has a higher mean temperature by 3 degrees, which is expected because it is a summer month.
- Another difference that we noticed is that even though it is relatively hotter in June, there's a higher amount of precipitation in the month of December. December receives approximately 7 percent more precipitation than June.
- The last difference we notice is that the temperature maximum and minimum for the month of December has a large difference than June. December is eight degrees lower than June at 56 degrees, however, its maximum temperature is only two degrees lower than June. This could be due to the larger amount of precipitation.

## Summary

In conclusion, I believe that W.Avy could operate his business in this weather. The only issues he would face is the weather and the temperature becoming low. However, the weather in Oahu seems optimal for a surf shop business in the weather we see in the data. One query I would look into is the different kinds of precipitation that occurs in Oahu. Another query I would look into is the research of offshore winds and how it affects surfing.
